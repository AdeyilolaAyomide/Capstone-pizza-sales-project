### Tools

- Microsoft Power BI: Data visualization

### Data formatting

The following tasks were performed:
- Data loading into MySQL
- Data formatting was done for the date and time columns of the dataset to present them in formats recognizable by MySQL in preparation for EDA

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Exploratory data analysis was done to answer key questions which include:

   - What is the total price of pizza sold?
   - How many quantities of pizza was sold?
   - What pizza size and category made the highest sales?

### Results

- The total price of pizza sold during the analysed period is $8.50K
- The total quantity of pizza sold during the analysed period is 509 pieces
- Large (L) pizza size made the highest sales ($4.39K) while "Classic" pizza category made the highest sales ($2.35K)  
- There is a strong association between sales and pizza size with the large pizzas making over 50% of the entire sales

### Visualization

Power BI was connected to SQL server and the tables generated during analysis was used to create a "Capstone pizza sales analysis" dashboard.
Power BI file is labelled "Capstone_b_s.pbix" and attached.

### Recommendation

1. More resources should be directed towards prodcution and sales of pizzas of Large (L) size
2. Production of pizzas of the Extra-large (XL) size can be be suspended and it's resources channelled to a more prodcutive pizza size.
